"Alive" is a powerful 45-minute ensemble work that explores themes of resilience, rebirth, and cultural memory through the integration of traditional Javanese dance with contemporary movement vocabularies. Created in response to the global pandemic and its impact on artistic communities, the piece examines what it means to remain vital and connected in times of isolation.

The work features five dancers who navigate between solo introspection and collective celebration, using traditional Indonesian instruments alongside electronic soundscapes. The choreography draws from the Javanese concept of "urip" (life force) and the cyclical nature of existence, weaving together ancient court dance forms with release technique and contact improvisation.

Central to "Alive" is the idea that cultural traditions are living, breathing entities that evolve through each generation. The dancers embody this concept through movement that honors classical Indonesian forms while embracing contemporary expression, creating a dialogue between heritage and innovation that speaks to the immigrant experience and the universal human need for connection.

The costume design incorporates traditional batik patterns reimagined through modern silhouettes, while the lighting design creates environments that shift between intimate personal spaces and expansive communal realms. Original music by Indonesian-American composer Gema Swaratyagita blends gamelan instruments with electronic processing, creating a sonic landscape that mirrors the choreographic fusion.

"Alive" has been praised for its "breathtaking synthesis of tradition and modernity" (The New York Times) and its "deeply moving exploration of cultural identity in the 21st century" (Dance Magazine). The work continues to tour internationally, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and celebrating the transformative power of dance.
