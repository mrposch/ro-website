"Social Affairs" is a collaborative ensemble work that examines the politics of touch, proximity, and social interaction through the contrasting lenses of Indonesian court dance and American social dance forms. Created for eight dancers, the piece navigates the complex negotiations of personal space, cultural protocols, and human connection in our contemporary moment.

The work juxtaposes the highly codified, hierarchical movement vocabulary of Javanese court dance - where every gesture carries social meaning and dancers rarely touch - with the informal intimacy of American social dances from swing to salsa. Through this contrast, "Social Affairs" reveals how culture shapes our most basic human interactions and challenges audiences to examine their own assumptions about appropriate social behavior.

Structured in five movements, the piece progresses from formal distance to chaotic intimacy before finding a new synthesis. The opening section presents the dancers in traditional court formations, moving with the controlled precision and indirect gaze characteristic of Javanese dance. Gradually, Western social dance forms infiltrate the space, creating moments of cultural collision and unexpected harmony.

The collaborative process involved dancers from both Indonesian and American backgrounds, each bringing their embodied knowledge to the creative process. This cross-cultural exchange in the studio mirrors the themes explored on stage, as performers navigate not just choreographic challenges but real questions of cultural translation and mutual understanding.

Musically, "Social Affairs" features an original score that weaves together gamelan orchestration with jazz, electronic beats, and found sound recordings from social gatherings across cultures. The costume design evolves throughout the performance, beginning with traditional Indonesian dress that gradually incorporates contemporary elements, visualizing the cultural fusion at the work's heart.

"Social Affairs" has been recognized as "a timely exploration of how we come together and pull apart" (The New Yorker) and received the 2023 Bessie Award for Outstanding Production.
