"One Take" is an improvisational solo work that challenges the boundaries between rehearsed performance and spontaneous creation. Performed without predetermined choreography, each iteration is unique, capturing the raw authenticity of unedited movement and the performer's immediate response to space, sound, and audience.

The piece emerged from my exploration of the Indonesian concept of "rasa" - the cultivated ability to sense and respond to subtle energies in performance. Drawing from my training in Javanese court dance, where improvisation within structure is essential, "One Take" applies these principles to contemporary solo performance, creating a framework for structured spontaneity.

Each performance begins with a simple prompt: to move continuously for 30 minutes without stopping, editing, or planning. The soundtrack, created live by musician collaborators, responds to the movement in real-time, creating a dialogue between sound and motion that unfolds organically. The lighting design remains minimal and responsive, allowing the focus to remain on the immediacy of the performer's choices.

The vulnerability required in "One Take" reflects broader themes of authenticity in an increasingly curated world. By removing the safety net of choreographic repetition, the work asks both performer and audience to embrace imperfection, spontaneity, and the beauty of the unrepeatable moment. Each performance becomes a meditation on presence, risk, and the courage required to share unfiltered artistic expression.

Critics have called "One Take" "a masterclass in embodied presence" (The Village Voice) and "a radical act of artistic transparency" (Brooklyn Rail). The work continues to evolve with each performance, accumulating layers of experience while maintaining its commitment to the immediacy of the present moment.
