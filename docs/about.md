## Artist Statement

As an Indonesian-American dance artist, I create work that bridges my Indonesian heritage with contemporary American dance forms. My choreography explores themes of cultural identity, displacement, and the universal language of movement that transcends borders.

Through my practice, I seek to challenge Western perspectives on Indonesian dance while honoring the traditional forms that shaped my artistic foundation. Each piece I create is a conversation between past and present, tradition and innovation, East and West.

My teaching philosophy centers on creating inclusive spaces where dancers of all backgrounds can explore movement as a tool for personal and cultural expression. I believe dance has the power to build bridges between communities and foster cross-cultural understanding.
